## ðŸ”§ Important Implementation Notes

### **1. Donation Form Validation Rules**

- **Pin Code**: Exactly 6 digits
- **Amount**: Must be positive number
- **Transaction ID**: Must be unique (backend validates)
- **State**: Must be valid Indian state

### **2. Event Image Validation Rules**
- **Single Image**: `image` field accepts one valid image URL
- **Multiple Images**: `images` array accepts multiple valid image URLs
- **Requirements**: At least one image is required (either `image` or `images` array)
- **Format**: URLs must end with .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, or .webp
- **Protocol**: Must start with http:// or https://
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing events with single `image` field continue to work

### **3. CGCC 2025 Registration Validation Rules**
- **registrationVia**: Must be "Balavihar Centre", "School", or "Other"
- **otherSpecify**: Required and non-empty only when registrationVia is "Other"
- **firstName, lastName, schoolName, parentName**: Required, non-empty strings

- **mobileNo**: Must match ^[6-9]\d{9}$ (Indian mobile format)
- **emailAddress**: Must be valid email format
- **dateOfBirth**: Must be valid date, not in the future
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate registrations by email + mobile combination

### **4. Security Considerations**
- Rate limiting: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP for donations
- Rate limiting: 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP for CGCC registrations
- Input sanitization automatically applied
- Image URL validation for security
- PAN numbers are hashed before storage (donations)
- All registration attempts logged for audit

### **5. Error Handling**
- **400**: Validation errors (missing/invalid fields, invalid image URLs)
- **404**: Resource not found (for GET, PUT, DELETE by ID)
- **409**: Duplicate transaction ID (donations) or duplicate registration (CGCC)
- **429**: Rate limit exceeded
- **500**: Server error

### **6. Success Response Formats**

**Event Creation Success:**
```json
{
  "_id": "64f8a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0",

## ðŸ†• **New Multiple Images Feature**

### **Key Benefits:**

- âœ… **Comprehensive**: `allImages` virtual field combines all images
- âœ… **Validated**: All image URLs are validated for format and security
- âœ… **CRUD Complete**: Full create, read, update, delete support

### **Frontend Integration Tips:**
- Use `allImages` field to display all images (recommended)

- Handle both formats for maximum compatibility
- Validate image URLs on frontend before submission
